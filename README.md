# Sync Party

---

**v0.12.0 is a massive breaking change.**
Make sure to copy your database file (`server/db`) into a different folder, as the path of this file has changed.
You can copy your old database back into `data` after the upgrade is done.

## Contributing

If you spot a bug or want to contribute feel free to create an issue.

## Requirements

-   A Linux server (tested with Ubuntu 20.04)
-   Node.js >= 14
-   pm2 globally installed
-   SSL certificate (e.g. Let's Encrypt)

## Setup

-   Clone the repository
-   `npm ci`
-   Copy `.env.example`
-   Rename to `.env`
-   Enter your specific config values
-   Create users (`npm run build` the app beforehand):
    You can run the following commands with a preceding space, preventing the passwords from being written into your bash history.
    -   Create an admin user:
        -   Choose an excellent & unique password!
        -   `[SPACE] npm run cli create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> admin`
    -   Create other users:
        -   Choose a good & unique password! Users can upload arbitrary files to your server.
        -   `[SPACE] npm run cli create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>`

## Production

-   Configure the `.env` files to run the app exposing a **different** port for the server & the websockets server
-   Use a reverse proxy to map requests to your domain to the app and use SSL (see example below)
-   Make sure your firewall is configured correctly
-   You might want to use a tool like `authbind` to run pm2 without root; see https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/specifics/#listening-on-port-80-w-o-root
-   `npm run deploy`

### nginx Reverse Proxy Example

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    }

    location /socket.io/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:4000/socket.io/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    location /peerjs/ {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000/peerjs/;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }

    include /etc/letsencrypt/options-ssl-nginx.conf; # managed by Certbot

```

## Development

You have to start two processes for development.

-   `npm run dev:server`
-   `npm run dev:client`

### Architecture

SyncParty is written in TypeScript, using ES Modules throughout.

The server uses my 'framework' TSFS (https://github.com/steeelydan/tsfs). TSFS uses Express, Sequelize, sqlite, express-session. Cookie-based authentication: Passport.js.

The client is a React application in TypeScript.

Realtime communication is realized with Socket.io. Video chat via PeerJS.

The built client application is delivered via the app server. If you run `npm run deploy`, the built files are copied into the `public` dir of the build folder. An `index.html` is statically served to respond to all requests, except those routed to `/api/...`. A reverse proxy like nginx is needed to use HTTPS. You can find an example configuration above.

## Admin CLI

`[SPACE TO BYPASS BASH HISTORY] npm run cli ` +

-   `create-user <USERNAME> <PASSWORD> [admin]`
-   `list-users`
-   `delete-user <USERNAME>`
-   `delete-all-users`
-   `change-password <USERNAME> <NEW PASSWORD>`
